What is PDA-T2 Experimental?

PDA-T2 Experimental are all the files I'm currently working on for the newest PDA-T2.1 update.

What does it do?

PDA-T2 Experimental aims to provide a stable player experience to someone with no knowledge of the Japanese language. Basically, make the core game  understandable and usable to a non-Japanese speaker. It is not a completely accurate translation, think of it as a localisation project.

The majority of content will be translated by the updated final release.

How do I install it?

PD-Loader:
1. Download PDA-T2 Experimental's files.
2. Place the MFTE folder in the MDATA folder of your PDAFT directory.
3. Run the game, enjoy!

NOTE: If you are using an MDATA-based mod that adds songs or new charts, simply rename the MFTE folder to a number lower MXXX folder than the MDATA folder containing the new songs/graphics/charts. Please do not report issues about mod translations or incompatibility with custom graphics or songs, you will have to consult the mod creator.

Alternative Install (please dont do this you moron):
1. Download PDA-T2 Experimental's files.
2. Replace the existing files with their appropriate PDA-T2 counterparts in the rom folder.
3. Run the game, enjoy!

Please note no help will be provided if you opt to use the alternative install as it is HIGHLY advised against and will overwrite important game files in the case you need to replace them or update.

Something is wrong, what can I do?

If there's an issue with the graphics or text (apart from the font) used in PDA-T2, please let me know either by making an issue on GitHub or messaging me on Discord at Jay39#7310.

Can I upload footage of the game using this translation to YouTube?

Yes, BUT with credit to me for the patch or a link to PDA-T2 either in the Description or Video itself. Same applies for other social networking sites or video hosting. Getting real tired of you bitches that use this shit as if it grows on trees, it doesn't, this is something I am choosing to do during my free-time as a university student to help the diva community, please be respectful and just show some credit/recognition of my efforts. :)
