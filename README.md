# PDA-T2
What is PDA-T2?

PDA-T2 is the continuation of the PDA-T project that I started a few months back to make the game Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Arcade playable in English to some extent. With the public dump of Arcade Future Tone, I thought a new revision of this project was in order.

What does it do?

PDA-T2 aims to provide a stable player experience to someone with no knowledge of the Japanese language. Basically, make the core game  understandable and usable to a non-Japanese speaker. It is not a completely accurate translation, think of it as a localisation project.

The module select, lyrics, titles and various screens will all be translated by the final release.

How do I install it?

DivaLoader + Separated MDATA:
1. Download PDA-T2's files.
2. Place the rom folder's contents in your rom folder where PDAFT is located.
3. Place the MDATA folder's contents in the MDATA folder where PDAFT is located.
4. Run the game, enjoy!

Cainan's MDATA Merged Patch:
1. Download PDA-T2's files.
2. First, place the contents of the rom folder in your rom folder.
3. Then, place the contents of the MDATA folder in your rom folder, where things such as mdata_pv_db should be located.
4. Run the game, enjoy!

Something is wrong, what can I do?

If there's an issue with the graphics or text (apart from the font) used in PDA-T2, please let me know either by making an issue on GitHub or messaging me on Discord at Jay39#7310.

Can I upload footage of the game using this translation to YouTube?

Yes, but with credit to PDA-T2 either in the Description or Video itself. Same applies for other social networking sites or video hosting.
