What is PDA-T2?

PDA-T2 is the continuation of the PDA-T project that I started a few months back to make the game Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Arcade playable in English to some extent. With the public dump of Arcade Future Tone, I thought a new revision of this project was in order.

What does it do?

PDA-T2 aims to provide a stable player experience to someone with no knowledge of the Japanese language. Basically, make the core game  understandable and usable to a non-Japanese speaker. It is not a completely accurate translation, think of it as a localisation project.

The module select, lyrics, titles and various screens will all be translated by the final release.

How do I install it?

DivaLoader + Separated MDATA (Extremely Recommended):
1. Download PDA-T2's files.
2. Place the M998 folder in the MDATA folder of your PDAFT directory.
3. Run the game, enjoy!

NOTE: If you are using an MDATA-based mod that adds songs or new charts, simply rename the M998 folder to a lower number. Please do not report issues about mod translations, you'd have to ask the creator.

Alternative Install (Advanced Users):
1. Download PDA-T2's files.
2. Replace the existing files with their appropriate PDA-T2 counterparts in the rom folder.
3. Run the game, enjoy!

Something is wrong, what can I do?

If there's an issue with the graphics or text (apart from the font) used in PDA-T2, please let me know either by making an issue on GitHub or messaging me on Discord at Jay39#7310.

Can I upload footage of the game using this translation to YouTube?

Yes, but with credit to PDA-T2 either in the Description or Video itself. Same applies for other social networking sites or video hosting.
